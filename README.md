afl-unicorn let's you fuzz any piece of binary that can be emulated by [Unicorn Engine](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/). 

For an in-depth description of what this is, how to install it, and how to use it check out this [blog post](https://medium.com/@njvoss299/afl-unicorn-fuzzing-arbitrary-binary-code-563ca28936bf).

For general help with AFL, please refer to both the official [AFL website](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) and the documents in the /doc/ directory.
